We Connect - Connecting Communities 


## Mission

Our app provides a central medium for Jamaicans to access community based information that is reliable and relevant. Users are allowed to share information. Also, information is sourced from reputable local sources on a regular basis. Only verified users are allowed access. It rejects known criminals and others of bad repute from joining the app. Additionally, the app provides a friendly interface that is just as easy to use as popular social apps.
